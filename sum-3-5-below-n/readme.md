# 🔢 Sum of Multiples of 3 and 5

This project calculates the sum of all natural numbers below a given limit that are divisible by **3 or 5**. It ensures that each multiple is counted only once and handles negative inputs gracefully by returning 0.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these numbers is 23.

Write a function that returns the sum of all multiples of **3 or 5** below a given number.

---

## ✅ Features

- Accepts a number `n` and returns the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below `n`.
- If the number is negative, it returns `0`.
- Avoids duplicate counting (e.g., 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5, but only counted once).
- Written in JavaScript with simple and readable logic.
- Includes basic unit tests using Jest.

## 🧮 Example

```js
sumOfMultiples(10); 
// Output: 23
// Explanation: 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23
